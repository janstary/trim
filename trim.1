.Sh NAME
.Nm trim
.Nd zero the lower bits of signal samples
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar bits
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads signal samples from standard input
(little-endian 32 bit signed integers)
and writes them back to standard output,
zeroing the given number of low-order
.Ar bits .
Note that the sample rate and the number of channels
is irrelevant to this.
.Pp
The default number of zeroed bits is zero:
.Nm
copies the samples unaltered and reports
how many lower bits are already zero.
