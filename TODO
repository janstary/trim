LE/BE
	Mind the byte-order when reading/writing the samples

We assume int16_t samples now
	Generalize to everything else, using suffixes such as ".s16"
	Note that te same also works for the lower bits of floats.

channels
	Report for each channel separately.
	Assume channels to be interlaced.
	
examples
	Have some example files and use the in the Makefile,
	perhaps using aucat/sox to play them.
